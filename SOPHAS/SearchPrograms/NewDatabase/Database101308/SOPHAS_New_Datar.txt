The program prepares graduates to work as epidemiologists in a public health setting.

Public health agencies and organizations, including universities, have a need for leaders with an in-depth understanding of the conditions and determinants of health and disease in the population.  These leaders may develop new programs, may conduct in-depth independent evaluations of programs or may conduct applied research that is relevant to program implementation.  They may also teach public health to current and future public health professionals.  The range of employment opportunities for graduates includes faculty positions, evaluation positions and health director positions."

Biostatistics (BIOS)	3	0	0	Yes		"Biostatistics is the science that applies statistical theory and methods to the solution of problems in the biological sciences. The biostatistician differs from the traditional statistician in that he or she is confronted by a wider range of problems dealing with all the phenomena that affect people?s physical, social, and mental well-being.

Public Health Informatics is the science underlying the integration of computer science, information science, and public health science applied to the acquisition, management, processing, analysis, and synthesis of public health data, information, and knowledge supporting public health research, education, and practice.

Bioinformatics is defined as the field of science in which biology, computer science, biostatistics and information technology merge to form a single discipline.  Bioinformatics more properly refers to the creation and advancement of algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data."

Applied Epidemiology 	11	8	47	Yes		"The Applied Epidemiology option is geared to meeting the needs of the student who anticipates working as an epidemiologist in a practice-based setting. While the practice setting envisioned in developing this curriculum is a national, state/regional, or local government public health agency, practice settings may include health care institutions, pharmaceutical or other health care industry companies, international agencies, or foundations where epidemiologists are employed.

Applied Epidemiology courses will integrate content from the Rollins School of Public Health traditional MPH degree program in epidemiology into the CMPH distance-based learning format. In addition to dressing the core competencies that are part of CMPH training at the Rollins School of Public Health, the curriculum will also address the Applied Epidemiology competencies developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Within this area of concentration, students may elect to focus on infectious diseases, maternal and child health, or chronic disease epidemiology."

Epidemiology (EPI)	11	0	0	Yes		"Epidemiology is a challenging career choice, especially for individuals with a strong interest in biology and with analytic skills. There is a need for epidemiologists now and in the next millennium who understand the potential of predicting disease occurrence. Our curriculum is grounded in the methodologies of epidemiology and biostatistics that enable graduates to contribute new thinking in the field. We are interested in educating the epidemiologists of the future who will foster this science into its next level.

Emory has some unique features which may be attractive to you. Our close collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is located adjacent to our campus, in addition to our close collaborations with the State Health Department, Emory Medical School and The American Cancer Society, offers research projects for our students as well as career opportunities. 

Our curriculum is highly quantitative and therefore we recruit students with excellent analytical skills and a strong science background."

Epidemiology (EPI)	11	0	0	Yes		"Epidemiology is a challenging career choice, especially for individuals with a strong interest in biology and with analytic skills. There is a need for epidemiologists now and in the next millennium who understand the potential of predicting disease occurrence. Our curriculum is grounded in the methodologies of epidemiology and biostatistics that enable graduates to contribute new thinking in the field. We are interested in educating the epidemiologists of the future who will foster this science into its next level.

Emory has some unique features which may be attractive to you. Our close collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is located adjacent to our campus, in addition to our close collaborations with the State Health Department, Emory Medical School and The American Cancer Society, offers research projects for our students as well as career opportunities. 

Our curriculum is highly quantitative and therefore we recruit students with excellent analytical skills and a strong science background."

Both degrees are internationally recognized and highly regarded.

Typical employment opportunities include international development work in developing countries in nutrition, health education, policy and management, reproductive health, in social or psychosocial programs in HIV/AIDS (orphans and vulnerable children, elderly caring for family members, persons living with HIV/AIDS), and social or psychosocial programs for refugees due to natural disasters or war."

Epidemiology	11	4	0	yes		"The M.S. (Master of Science) degree is an academic degree that offers research training in epidemiology with an emphasis on the understanding of theoretical issues and the application of disciplinary methods to the study of public health problems. The program includes course work in epidemiology and biostatistics, and a research-based master's thesis is required. This degree is also appropriate for physicians or other health professionals who prefer a more focused program than the M.P.H. to prepare for research and teaching careers. The M.S. degree differs from the M.P.H. in that it is intended for students interested primarily in the academic subject matter of the field rather than in professional practice. It is also a natural entry point for those who will eventually continue for their PhD. Thus, students focus on building a strong foundation in a particular specialty field, including its pertinent research methods. No practice placement is required."

Biostatistics	3	0	0	Yes		"Biostatistics is the science that applies statistical theory and methods to the solution of problems in the biological sciences. The biostatistician differs from the traditional statistician in that he or she is confronted by a wider range of problems dealing with all the phenomena that affect people?s physical, social, and mental well-being.

Public Health Informatics is the science underlying the integration of computer science, information science, and public health science applied to the acquisition, management, processing, analysis, and synthesis of public health data, information, and knowledge supporting public health research, education, and practice.

Bioinformatics is defined as the field of science in which biology, computer science, biostatistics and information technology merge to form a single discipline.  Bioinformatics more properly refers to the creation and advancement of algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data."

Public Nutrition	33	0	0	Yes		"Public Nutrition addresses population-based dietary and nutritional problems by elucidating their extent, determinants, and consequences, and the policies and programs to address them. Nutritional problems exist at national, community, and individual levels and include hunger, childhood malnutrition, famine, suboptimal growth, infection, dietary imbalance or deficiency, and chronic disease. Public Nutrition requires a global perspective, spanning the concerns of wealthy and poor nations. A solid understanding of the biology of nutrition and the socioeconomic and demographic influences on nutrition in conjunction with the principles of design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions is necessary to transform knowledge into the action of public policy and nutrition programs. Students from developed or developing countries can use these skills to serve government ministries, private voluntary organizations, technical agencies, applied research institutions, and universities. The MSPH program in Public Nutrition has a focus in research and advanced rigorous courses in math and science."

Environmental Health	10	19	0	yes		"The JD/MSPH program is an expansion of the mid-career program in which 42 credits are required in the school of public health and 79 credits in the law school over a four-year period. Mutual acceptance of elective courses provides a time savings to the student of approximately one year.

Law school course credit may be applied toward the environmental health sciences degree. This credit is in addition to the 28 hours taken in the school of public health. Twelve credits of relevant course work may be applied specifically: ocean and coastal law; resources, energy and environmental law; energy law; water law; and land-Use planning. The research (or practicum) will be done at a site approved by both schools.

The general learning objective of these programs is to promote appreciation of the technical complexities and legal ramifications of the technical complexities and legal ramifications involving environmental policy, planning, and regulations. The graduate is able to integrate scientific and legal principles involved in the recognition, evaluation and control of environmental."
