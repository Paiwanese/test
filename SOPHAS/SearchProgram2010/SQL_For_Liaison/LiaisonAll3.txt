By close of business tomorrow, can you export for me out of the search database for FALL 2010 only and only US or Both for applicant type
1)	Name of school
2)	Name of degree
3)	Name of program
4)	Name of concentration
5)	Distance learning “yes” or “no” or “both”
6)	1 year or less “yes” or “no”

What I’m trying to find out is out of xyz possible degrees offered by schools, xyz % are offered by distance learning and xyz % are offered in a 1 year or less format.  I’ll do the calculations but I need the raw data.

dc.ConcentrationName, t.fullterm as Term, at.applicantType, ct.softdeadline+' 11:59:59 PM' as SoftDeadline, ct.harddeadline+' 11:59:59 PM' as HardDeadline,
dep.DepartmentName, area.areaofinterestName, op.OptionName

AND (ct.expireYesNo IS NULL OR ct.expireYesNo = 0)
order by ms.memberschoolName, DegreeName, ProgramName, concentrationName
