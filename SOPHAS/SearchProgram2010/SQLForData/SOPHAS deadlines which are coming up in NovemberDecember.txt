Can you run me a query of all SOPHAS deadlines which are coming up in November/December?


SELECT c.concentrationID,  ms.MemberschoolName, d.degreeName,
d.programName, c.concentrationName,t.fullterm,  a.applicanttype, ct.HardDeadline,
ct.SoftDeadline,cd.sophasstatus, ct.SOPHASStatus as IncludeApplicantsPortal, 
ct.ExpireYesNo
FROM ConcentrationTerms ct 
JOIN Concentrations c on ct.concentrationID = c.concentrationID
JOIN designations d on d.designationID = c.designationID
JOIN MemberSchools ms on ms.memberschoolID = d.memberschoolID
JOIN concentrationDetails cd on cd.concentrationID = c.concentrationID
JOIN terms t on t.termID = ct.termID
JOIN applicanttypes a on a.ApplicantTypeID = ct.ApplicantTypeID
WHERE d.designationStatus = 1
AND c.concentrationStatus = 1
AND cd.SearchEnabled = 1
AND (ct.expireYesNo IS NULL OR ct.expireYesNo = 0) 
AND ((HardDeadline LIKE '11/%/2010') OR
                      (SoftDeadline LIKE '11/%/2010')OR
                      (HardDeadline LIKE '12/%/2010')OR
                      (SoftDeadline LIKE '12/%/2010'))
order by ms.memberschoolname, d.degreeName, d.programName, c.concentrationName
